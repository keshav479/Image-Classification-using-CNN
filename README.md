We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of cats and dogs, addressing a fundamental challenge in computer vision. We assemble a diverse dataset and preprocess the images for effective model training. Our CNN architecture, designed with convolutional and fully connected layers, extracts features crucial for classification. Through rigorous training and optimization, including data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning, our model achieves impressive performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Visualization techniques provide insights into the model's decision-making process. The successful development of our CNN model holds promise for practical applications such as pet identification and content filtering. This study underscores the potential of CNNs in solving complex image classification tasks and sets the stage for further advancements in computer vision and neural networks.
